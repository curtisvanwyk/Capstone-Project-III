# Capstone-Project-III
The following project provides an analysis for the importation of various fuels into South Africa for 2010 to 2011.
The data being analysed has been imported from the fuel.csv [Dataset used in analysis](fuelimports.csv/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
dataset which provided data regarding where the fuel is imported from, the tariffs associated with the fuel, where 
the fuel is imported to, the statistical unit used to measure the fuel (which can be used to determine fuel type), 
detailed descriptions of the fuel, how the fuel has been transported to its destination and the customs value of the fuel.
The data has been organised, cleaned and analysed using matplotlib. This was also used to create comprehensive visualizations for the
dataset. [Organisation and cleaning of data](CapstoneProjectIII.ipynb/CONTRIBUTING.md)
The analysis shows that: [Organisation and cleaning of data](EDA.docx/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Germany is the largeest provider of fuel to South Africa
- Indonesia, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Thailand and Brazil has the highest tariffs on fuels
- The most commonly imported fuels are lubricating fuels
- 41.7% of the fuel is imported from Europe
- Most of imports are made to the Durban district
- Tariff rates will be influenced by the transport code
- Tariff rates and customs value tend to be directly proportional
